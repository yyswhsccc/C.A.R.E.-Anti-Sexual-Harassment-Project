# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Naming Convention

- **Feature development:** `feature/yourname-shortdesc`  
  Example: `feature/alice-login`
- **Bug fix:** `fix/yourname-shortdesc`  
  Example: `fix/bob-db-connection`

## Collaboration Workflow

1. Always create a new branch from `main` for your work (do not work directly on `main`).
2. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature/fix branch to `main`.
4. At least one team member should review your PR before merging.
5. Once approved, merge the PR into `main`.

## General Tips

- Write clear commit messages.
- Keep PRs focused on one topic/feature/fix.
- Do not commit sensitive files (e.g., `config.php`, `.env`).
- Update documentation as needed.
